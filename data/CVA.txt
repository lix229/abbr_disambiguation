CVA|cerebrovascular accident|CVA|165|167|REASON FOR CONSULTATION|HEMATOLOGY CONSULTATION: REASON FOR CONSULTATION: I have been asked to see _%#NAME#%_ by his consulting neurologist (Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_) regarding his recent CVA and possible underlying hypercoaguable state.

CVA|cerebrovascular accident|CVA.|138|141|HOSPITAL COURSE|Cardiology recommended enoxaparin for anticoagulation, and I suspect he will likely be on Coumadin given his significant risk factors for CVA. Echocardiogram did not demonstrate any significant valvular lesions, but did demonstrate significant left ventricular dysfunction as mentioned above. The patient was transferred to Fairview Southdale Hospital by Cardiology on _%#MMDD2005#%_ for consideration of coronary angiogram.
CVA|costovertebral angle|CVA|210|212|PHYSICAL EXAMINATION|ABDOMEN: soft, normoactive bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness to minimal palpitation, pain worse in right upper quadrant. There is no guarding.

CVA|cerebrovascular accident|CVA,|242|245|ASSESSMENT|Urine showed some white cells with clumps and many bacteria. Urine culture is pending. ASSESSMENT: A _%#1914#%_ with left lower quadrant pain, mass, and guaiac positive stool, dementia, depression, abdominal aortic aneurysm, tibial fracture, CVA, seizures, and hypertension. PLAN: She has well-documented DNR/DNI in her chart, and this has been signed recently by nurse with power of attorney.
CVA|cerebrovascular accident|CVA,|270|273|IMPRESSION AND PLAN|Obviously symptoms are consistent with an acute cerebrovascular accident. There is no bleed on the CT scan and the preliminary report of the MRI showed a right acute brain infarct and no evidence of bleeding. Definitely atrial fibrillation is the highest risk for acute CVA, also the severe hypertension. We will keep the patient on heparin at this time after 5 hours of onset of symptoms and being on heparin for few hours now, he is not a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and the risk from thrombolytics definitely outweighs the benefit at this time, and this was discussed and agreed by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ from Neurology service.

CVA|cerebrovascular accident|CVA|149|151|IMPRESSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS|This likely reflects cerebrovascular involvement, as well as resolving acute confusional state, that may be associated with the acute effects of her CVA (e.g., edema) or medication effects. This likely reflects an evolving picture, and it may be helpful to repeat her neuropsychological evaluation in three months to determine whether her cognitive difficulties progress, remit, or remain stable.

CVA|cerebrovascular accident|(CVA)|238|242|RECOMMENDATIONS|I believe that there is a 1-2% mortality risk, and a 3-5% risk of significant morbidity related mostly to the patient's obesity and lower extremity swelling and diabetes mellitus. Also he is at increased risk for cerebrovascular accident (CVA) because of his past history of cerebrovascular disease and cerebellar infarct. I have discussed risks, benefits and indications of surgery with the patient.
